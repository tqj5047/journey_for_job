Last night, looking at my robinhood account and wallstreetbets, I realized how much money I missed by not going to stock market but invested in a bootcamp. So I decided to make a website about it and come back in time every year and tell you if I regret the decision to do so and why.
Update 1/26/21:
I should probably add game stop to the page ;)
I don't really read wallstreetbets,I am just in it for the memes.
